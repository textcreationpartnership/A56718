         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BE it known unto you, Oh ye Children of men, that the ſigns of Chriſts ſecond coming ſoundeth daily in our ears, how often have we ſeen wonders in the heavens above us? and how hath the earth trembled and quaked beneath us? how many falſe Prophets have there been, that own no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt but the light within them? how great is the apoſtatizing from the truth? how is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt getting up to his height? how doth the noiſe of Wars ſound aloud in our ears? how many thouſands hath the peſtilence ſwept away in a moment? how have the Saints been afflicted and perſecuted, of whom the World was not worthy? how much treachery and deceit is there in every corner? how much hatred and malice, meerly for profeſſing Religion? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceivers have ſpread themſelves abroad in the world? how doth iniquity abound in every village? how cold is love grown in all perſons? how doth drunkenneſs and gluttony ſurpaſs ages
<pb facs="tcp:33360:4"/>paſt, and famine ſucceed in many places? how great are the variances that are in Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Churches and Families; nay, among own Relations, they are directly oppoſite one to the other? among theſe ſixteen ſigns of Chriſts coming, this is none of the leaſt, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath but a ſhort ſeaſon, and therefore he is the more buſie to keep people ignorant of their duty, that they may be employed to ſerve ſin; to hinder him in his purpoſe about the breach of Amity is my main deſign, for at preſent it is my purpoſe to let you know what amity has been, and ought to be, between near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that ſo we may arrive at that ever laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amity and felicity which we all aim at. Many there are that have tuned a ſtring or two on this ſubject, but I at preſent never ſaw, nor heard of any that have played a whole leſſon on it, and therefore I who am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this task, for the Honour of God and the grace of Religion, have caſt my ſmall mite, into the great and rich treaſury of Knowledge, though I know this Learned, Critical, Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Eagle-eyed Age may look on my lines and cenſure them or me, as not being Rhetorically a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, and Logically digeſted, and drawn out in the flouriſhes of the times, but let them know, that the manner of the ancient times was to be plain, <hi>1 Cor. 1.27.</hi> The Subject matter

                     </item>
                     <item>4 Doct. <hi>That Children ought to yield obedience to all their Parents Commands in the Lord, with holy Reverence, Honour and Zeal.</hi>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33360:8"/>
                     <item>5 Doct. <hi>That the Lord doth take great care for the eternal good of thoſe that cannot any ways take care for themſelves.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But to the <hi>firſt Doctrine.</hi> That Parents ſhould avoid all occaſions of Provocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Here I ſhall ſhew you, what may be properly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Provocations,</hi> that ſo Parents may take them out of the way, that they do not cauſe their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſtumble, fall, and be <hi>broken to pieces, Which are theſe ſixteen as followeth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> When Parents will not teach and inſtruct their Children, and ſlight and abuſe them if they do not learn: This is a hard Leſſon; if the Lord ſhould deal ſo with the Sons of Men, who of them but would fall immediately into the gulf of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair? among all the Children of men can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to reap where we never ſowed? If I had not known ſuch a thing as this to be, I could hardly have conceived, that ever any ſhould be ſo very auſtere and unnatural, or ever had been to the fruit of their own bowels: The wiſe man's Counſel to Fathers, is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.12. <hi>Apply thine heart to inſtruction;</hi> it ſhould be part of thy every days meditation, to conſider how thou ſhouldeſt inſtruct, teach and train up thy Child, in all things uppertaining to this Life, and that which is to come. <hi>Train up a Child</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) in the way he ſhould go,</hi> Prov. 22.6. which is rightly done by <hi>mild and gentle inſtructions, and not by cauſeleſs ſlighting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Second</hi> Provocation is, when Parents ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give their Children a good Word, nor a good Look, though the Child do whatever it poſſibly can to pleaſe them; if the Lord ſhould always frown upon thee, and ever ſpeak to thee with an angry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33360:8"/>Countenance and Words, how couldeſt thou be able to ſtand before him; conſider, it is a mild car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and loving ſpeech that doth win the heart: It was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. 'twas by gentle words and carriage that <hi>Abigal</hi> overcome <hi>David,</hi> though he was in great wrath, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.24. Love is a ſpecial winning grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>It doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly;</hi> ſoft words will ſtop ſin in its courſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. Mild Speeches become good Men; <hi>My Son,</hi> faith <hi>Abraham, God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,</hi> &amp;c. Read <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s manner of Speech to his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.1. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had offended him, yet he bleſſed him a ſecond time. To diſſwade your Children from ſin, let your Arguments be as hard as you will, but let your words be ſoft, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Hear me, my Brethren,</hi> ſaith King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.2. To all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who anſwered them <hi>churliſhly. Naphtali is ſaid to give goodly words,</hi> Gen. 49.21. Courteous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage hath an acceptance among all men, and the bleſſing of God is with it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.23. <hi>Let your words be ſeaſoned with grace,</hi> the Ornament of Scripture Language, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. avoid corrupt Speeches, that adminiſter no grace to the Hearers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. 'tis better not to ſpeak at all, than to ſpeak evil words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.21. by the nature of the expreſſions of a man, the intent of his <hi>heart is made manifeſt,</hi> Mat. 12.34. Prov. 12.25.15, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Provocation</hi> is, when Parents are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with any thing that their Children do, though they do to their utmoſt abilities what they can to pleaſe them. Such is the wickedneſs and hard heartedneſs of ſome covetous Parents, who would wring out their Childrens labours by a kind of Extortion, ſomething whereby to ſatisfie their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33360:9"/>greedy and diſcontented minds; though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men,</hi> Phil. 4.5. But their Children ſhall know but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it: And again he ſaith, <hi>be content with ſuch things as you have,</hi> Heb. 13.5. He that is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhall never be happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth Provocation</hi> is, when Parents ſhall pretend love to their Children before their Neighbours and Friends, and the Child can never find in very deed that they have any love at all for them: Such Hypocritical Parents will one day recieve a double ſtroke for this twofold Wickedneſs: Such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have not learned divine wiſdom, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. that teacheth other things, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.35. According. to your ſins ſhall your recompence be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6. Theſe outward Lovers and Whited Sepulchres are all in Tongue, and none in Heart, their Hope ſhall be like the Spiders web, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13.14. and their Joy but for a moment, <hi>Job</hi> 20.5. Saith st. <hi>Paul, Let your love be without diſſimulation,</hi> Rom. 12.9. Plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true love never fails, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. Methinks natural love is taught by all the birds in the Air, and Beaſts of the field; who many of them will loſe their own lives to preſerve their young; their Love is real and purely natural, without flattery or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: Why then ſhould ſome Parents be (worſe then Beaſts) without natural affections, <hi>'tis a ſign that the coming of Chriſt draweth near,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth Provocation</hi> is, when Parents ſhall let their Servants, or any body elſe, chaſtiſe, beat and abuſe their Children, and they take no notice of it, but do often allow of their ſo doing, with good liking and approbation, this very thing the wife man ſaith, is one of the four things the earth is diſquieted with, and ſo tedious that it cannot bare it; <hi>viz.</hi> A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant when he reigneth, <hi>prov.</hi> 30.21, 22. If Chriſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33360:9"/>call him an evil Servant, that ſmiteth his Fellow-Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. much more evil is he, that lifteth up his hand in ſmiting his Maſters Child, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.32. If Servants are to give to their Maſters double Honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. They are to ſhew ſome reverent reſpect to their Maſters Iſſue, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.12. The Lord has promiſed to puniſh ſuch Servants as are ſo wicked to fill their Maſters Houſe with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.9. When he cometh to ſearch <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> with candles; therefore Servants, if your Maſters be ſo ignorantly wicked, as to allow to you correct his Children, you may not, muſt not, do ſo vile a thing, by which the Child may be provoked, the earth diſquieted, and the Lord offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your maſters houſe filled with violence and diſtraction, for the Lord loveth Unity, Peace and Concord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</p>
               <p>Moreover, you of the Neighbourhood may not correct your Neighbours Children, but if they have tranſgreſſed, you muſt mildly acquaint their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with the offence, and the Parents are to give them due correction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24, 29, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. For the Lord hath put them in that place to rule and govern their Children at all Seaſons, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them according to their offences, with a ſevere Countenance, without flattery, with ſavoury expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhewing them the nature of their offence without railing or evil words, leaſt they learn that of you for which you correct them; alſo forbear giving threatning and provoking words, and then thy Correction will be no provocation but to good, and the obſtruction of evil: 'Tis good for every one to be employed in their own buſineſs, and not in the concerns of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth Provocation</hi> is, when parents hurry their Children night and day in their Worldly Buſineſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33360:10"/>and take no care about their Childrens Souls, or their Eternal Happineſs; when Children come to years of Underſtanding, and are capable to know the loſt ſtate of their Souls, and that its worth is more then the whole world, <hi>Mu.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. And their Parents have made no proviſion for them in this kind, not ſo much as to teach them to read the Word of the Lord, nor have inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their duty to God, nor taught them how to pray unto him, and worſhip him in no ſence nor kind, nor have inſtructed them to believe in Chriſt their Saviour; neither acquainted them with the Baptiſm of Repentance for remiſſion of Sins, alſo do keep them ignorant of the benefit of the body and blood of Chriſt in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and of holy walking with God and Man, in all duties of Love and Piety: Theſe things when the Child comes to underſtand, and that he can have no time nor means allowed in order to obtain his Souls peace, but all ways poſſible rather uſed to hinder him in all good ways: This is a very great Provocation, and therefore Parents above all things have a care in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That you inſtruct your Children in the way of the Lord betimes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. Let them ſuck in the Word with their Mothers Milk. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. The Lord commands the firſt fruits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the firſt born to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. <hi>The fat was the Lords, viz.</hi> the beſt; therefore do not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect early inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. And the Lord will give you an early recompence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh Provocation</hi> is, When Parents ſhall neglect their Children in temporal Education, as not to bring them up in ſuch a lawful calling, as that they may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33360:10"/>by it get a neceſſary livelyhood: And herein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to ſtudy their Childrens Conſtitutions and Abilities, and to put them out to ſuch employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as their ability of Body and Eſtate will not fail in the management of; for want of ſuch good Education many have been bred ſo idlely, who have had no Eſtates to maintain them, when their Parents are dead, and they come to Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſtate, that ſome have made away with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, others have ſled to Sea; ſome to be Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome fall into deep melancholly, and dye, others take to the High-way to Robbery, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Evils: Therefore Parents, you that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny king of Love at all for your Children, take <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> advice, <hi>To train them up in the way which they ſhould go, Prov.</hi> 22.6. Better unborn then untaught; 'tis far better to ſpend an hundred to give them good Education, than to give them thouſands without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Education at all; for that will abide with them, and be a portion, when riches fail, for they many times flee away as an Eagle towards Heaven, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their Children, that which they never intend they ſhall have; ſome have gone and tied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Covenant to Virgins, by vertue of their Parents Promiſes, and when the Parents have relinquiſhed it, it hath been the ruin of them both; Parents wickedneſs in this caſe, may be, and many times is, an hourly and daily Provocation to their Children, which makes them to live in Horror, Bondage, Diſcontent and Slavery, until the very day of their death, becauſe their Parents hindered them by it of their firſt choice, and ever after their affections can never be truly ſettled; alſo it cauſeth them to ſuſpect their Parents love; but this know,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33360:11"/>that Love ought to be honeſt, and without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. Do to your Children in this caſe, and eſteem their Peace as your own: There is no joy nor true peace where content is wanting; an hearts content is a continual feaſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents ſhall threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Children, that they will give them no portion, or cut them off, as many do, <hi>with a ſhilling:</hi> The Lord in the caſe of giving of Parents Eſtates, hath given forth a poſſitive Law, which though it were given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it being not ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or <hi>typical,</hi> but moral and perpetual, it extends its power to all Ages, Nations, Sects, Kindred, Tongues and People, to whom this Precept ſhall come, it being never as yet aboliſhed, which law you will find recorded in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15, 16, &amp; 17. <hi>That the Eldeſt if hated, yet he ſhall have a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>the youngeſt though beſt beloved, ſhall ſhare all alike:</hi> Have a care Parents in breaking this Law in threatning words, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9. much more in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions; <hi>He that breaketh one commandment is guilty of all,</hi> James 2.10. The Ten Commandments was given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but who dareth to deny, but all the moral part thereof, is perpetual, and extendeth its power to every individual perſon in the whole world, which Law to tranſgreſs would be a ſin in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and then the Lord may look on them, as he he did on <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſay, <hi>If thou doeſt not well, ſin lieth at thy door,</hi> Gen. 4.7.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventh Provocation</hi> is, Where Parents ſhall and do require more of their Children than their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Abilites will permit, or that is poſſible for them to undertake, or to accompliſh with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; ſuch Parents (if they may be ſo called) ſhew their Malice, by Frowns, Sour-Looks, Evil Words, nay, and many times by Curſings and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and ſometimes with cruel and mercileſs blows; here they let looſe their reins, and run at random in the road to Deſtruction, without either pauſe, conſideration, or affections, as though they were deſtitute of all grace; ſuch Parents want pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. and cannot wait till their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Acquirements will in time produce their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effects: <hi>Look not for an old head on young ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Children are not perfect Men the firſt year; wait and inſtruct them with love and patience, and in time you will have of them what you requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the Proverb is, <hi>Rome was not built in one day.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Children to ask them a Queſtion, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them with blows, or throwing ſomething at them. <hi>Jonathan</hi> did but ask <hi>Saul</hi> his Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall <hi>David</hi> be ſlain? what hath he done? but he was ſo angry with him, that <hi>he threw a javelin at Jonathan.</hi> Theſe are hard lines, when Parents will not ſuffer their Children to ſpeak one word to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Wrath, or to know anothers faults: The Lord ſaith, <hi>When thy Children ſhall ask thee Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, thou ſhalt anſwer them rightly to what they ask,</hi> Joſhua 4.6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents ſhall ſet a higher eſteem on one Child than on another; this is a great Provocation, this cauſed <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents will take no care to beſtow trades on their Children to their Content, but will force them to be brought up in an Employment which they neither like nor love; this cauſeth them to be careleſs and idle, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to be very ill Husbands and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, that they ruin their Eſtates, and beggar their Children, it many times brings them to ill Courſes for a Livelyhood, which ends in Impriſonment, and their Souls are in danger of Eternal Wo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.11. The Lord gave this Liberty in the time of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenth Provocation</hi> is, When Parents will force their Children againſt their will, to be yoked to thoſe they cannot love, nor at all affect; for a little filthy Lucre, as though the only Happineſs and chiefeſt good were in the Mammon of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9, 13. Piety and Virtue was the only thing <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Mother took notice of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.4. 19.14. 31.30. But inſtead of Piety, Prudence, Honeſty and Vertue, now a days if they be Sullen, Self-willed, Croſs, Obſtinate, Malicious, Deceitful, Jealous, Envious, Light-Carriaged, Inſatiably-Luſtful, Proud, Peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Fooliſh, Inconſtant, Diſcontented, Impure in Body and Mind, if Blear, Goggle, or Squint-Eyed, Wheezel-Faced, Hare-brain'd, Quarter-witted, Nonſenſical Ideots, Sanded, Tanned, Souer-lookt, and much deformed in all parts: Yet Money and Land muſt make up all the matter, and oyl the wheels of Matrimony, but do not forget that they that marry only for money, live all their Life time in bondage, in a kind of a lawful adultery, therefore in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33360:13"/>diſpoſing of your Children let love be the main, the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> let Prudence, Virtue, Piety and Honeſty, be the Objects, and the Hearts content the only Subject, and the Lord will be glorified in ſuch a choice: It is but reaſon you ſhould let your Children chooſe where and whom they like beſt, all their Lifes content depends upon it. Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ought to teach Parents this Leſſon, but the time is now come that ſome are without natural Affections, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. Nay, ſome Parents are ſo wicked and ungodly, as if a Child be ſo weak to marry without their conſent, yet marry a ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not riches anſwerable to their Eſtate, they thro' Pride and Ambition are ſo cruel, that they reject ſuch a dear ſon or daughter, and will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, nor be reconciled to them, but take ſuch devilliſh courſes that tend to deſtroy their Child both Body and Soul: Such ſhew they are ſo far without the true fear of God, that they are cruel Monſters, and without Natural Affections, nay, and they will not own nor look upon the Son-in-law or Daughter-in-law, nor the lawful Iſſue ſuch a Son has by ſuch a Daughter-in-law, or ſuch a Daughter has by ſuch a ſon-in-law, by which they ſhew themſelves malicious, filled with wrath and Envy, as well as unnatural, and violate Chriſts Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, will not forgive ſuch that have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that is, from their heart, and ſo muſt expect never to be forgiven, but periſh eternally, if they do not ſpedily repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthteenth Provocation</hi> is, When Children are come to a ſtate of Marriage, and capable to trade for themſelves in the World, their Parents will not give them any thing to aſſiſt them, but keep all in their own hands till they are dead; by this their Children live almoſt, if not all their days, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33360:14"/>and ſlavery, till they have almoſt, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether loſt their natural love to their Parents, and many times are under that grievous Temptation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their Parents, to wiſh and deſire their days may be ſhortened, which ſin cannot be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but all good Parents ſhould do their utmoſt endeavour to take this block out of their Childrens way: Alſo this cauſes them to take up diſhoneſt courſes, by private and publick Robberies, and Cheating Shifts, to get ſomething whereby to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their wants, and when they have eſcaped well once, it may be they are ſo far hardened, that they can never ſtop till it be too late: This is a Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed which terminates in the excution of Juſtice. I hope Parents my whetting up of your Memories will not offend you, if they do, I have in this done my duty in part, do you do all yours, and then ſee where you will have Occaſion of offence. I leave off with theſe ſixteen, which are the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Sum of my Experience, and leave it to them that are more accute to find out as many more as they pleaſe, and I will be content with theſe Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And ſo I paſs to the proof of this firſt Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Parents ſhould take all care poſſible to avoid all occaſions of Provocation,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 3.21. <hi>Provoke not your Children to anger,</hi> Pſal. 103.13. <hi>As a Father pitieth his Children,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 17.6, 10. <hi>The Glory of the Children is their Parents, Prov.</hi> 31.28. <hi>They call her bleſſed,</hi> Mat. 9.15. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber mourn ſo long as the Bride is with them:</hi> It will be very hard for Children to glory in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and call them bleſſed, when they are under Provocation and Mourning for their Parents miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing of them, in hard, unjuſt and wicked carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but I come to the Reaſons of the Doctrine, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33360:14"/>prove that they ought not to provoke their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Firſt Reaſon</hi> is taken from the Title, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Parents;</hi> now they ought as they hear themſelves called by that Title, to be touched with a feeling of the natural affections which is only proper to the fruit of their own Bowels and relation, as being their Image, and Spark of their Brightneſs, ſucceſſively; their own repreſentation and proper Off-ſpring. Would not he be a Monſter and not a man, that ſhould ſo far violate the Bounds of Nature, and ſo wilfully and willingly deſtroy his natural Iſſue: <hi>David,</hi> though his Son <hi>Abſolom</hi> were his mortal Enemy, yet he took great care, and gave a ſtrict charge for his preſervation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5. Parents ſhould think thus with themſelves, the Lord is our Father, even as we would he ſhould do unto us, even ſo ſhould we do to our Children; and if thus, I am ſure no Parents will give any juſt cauſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2d. Reaſon.</hi> Why Parents ſhould not give their Children any juſt Occaſion of Provocation is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Children be of their own Subſtance: Who is ſo mad as to cut his own Fleſh? how doth it cut the Child, even to the very heart, that it makes it weary of its life? to be under continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al provocation, it is a Pain intollerable, a Diſeaſe incurable, but as Scorpions Blood will beſt cure its own ſtinging, ſo no ſalve to heal the Childs wound but its parents true love and real affections, what a ſacred Bond of Unity is there in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament? what natural union is there among the Birds of the Air, and Beaſts of the Field? no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it, but by inducements to Hatred; Love and Concord continues ſtill; then why ſhould not Men be taught by natural things, to have and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33360:15"/>natural affections to their Children, and learn of the <hi>Lord, who doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of Men,</hi> Lament. 3.33. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans their conditions, and wills them to turn from iniquity, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.8. And is very pittyful and of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. So ſhould all Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3d. Reaſon</hi> is, Becauſe the Lord doth highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of all ſuch Parents as are godly, that be careful for, and tender of their Children: Shall I, ſaith the Lord, hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing that I do? why becauſe he will command his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Houſhold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17, 19. The Lord commends <hi>Job</hi> for a perfect and upright Man, whoſe work it feems was daily to offer Sacrifice for his Children, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.5, &amp; 8. For fear they had ſinned againſt the Lord; by this Parents ſhould learn to pray with and for their Children every day, the juſt man walketh in his integrity, his Children are bleſſed after him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. It is the Character of a Godly Biſhop, to have his Children in ſubjection, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. with all gravity. The Lord did make <hi>Iſrael</hi> to hear and fear, that they might teach their Children after them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Ch.</hi> 31.13. The Lord was ſo well pleaſed with King <hi>Jehu,</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>His Children ſhall ſit on the Throne of Iſrael, to the fourth Generation,</hi> 2 Kings 10.30. <hi>The Lord hath eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they ſhould make them known to their Children, that the Generations to come might know them, even the Children which would be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children, that they might ſet their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments at all times,</hi> Pſal. 78.5,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33360:15"/>6, 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. which truly being performed, takes off all juſt occaſion of Provocation.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4th. Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe Provocation is the high road to Childrens Diſobedience, and an evil inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental means to cauſe them to break the fifth Commandment, which ſaith, <hi>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother,</hi> Exod. 20.12. Provocation diſputes a Child into Fude and Anger, and what will you do to quench that flame? what will you call him then, but a furious, turbulent, outragious Monſter, no ways then to be diſputed with. Wrath carrieth down all before it, and cares not if he daſh himſelf in a thouſand pieces, he carries the Blood of Revenge in his Face, and his Eyes ſparkle like Fire, his Hair ſtands an end, and his Teeth gnaſh one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Countenance is fierce, and his Voice thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth without ſence or reaſon, his Brows are knit in fury, and the motion of his Head declares his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, his Hands ſtrike one againſt another, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with violence on his own Breaſt, he ſtampeth and teareth his Cloaths, and if it were poſſible his Fleſh from his Bones, he hath deteſtation in his mind, and Firebrands in one Hand with a drawn Sword in the other, yelling and houling with hideous Outcries, ſaying, I will ruine all, for I am undone. Wrath and Anger defaceth the Image of God in Man, and caſteth a miſt before the Eyes; it ſtops the Ears that he will not hear Inſtruction, and hinders his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from receiving Counſel; it is an Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judgment and Reaſon, the Senſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are dulled and blinded by it, and it cauſeth the heart to be continually ſtubborn, and ſubject to much evil, and what not. O then Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not Children to Anger, for in that condition you will hardly perſwade them to the Duty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, learn patience and be kind to them, and what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33360:16"/>great quiet of Conſcience can you have whilſt you ſee your Children ruined before your Eyes, by your folly and madneſs? would you have your Child hate you who begat him, and be your Enemy, becauſe you ſhew your ſelf an Enemy to him or to her? beſides, if the cauſe of your anger to your Child can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be prevented, as if it be in the Caſe of Marriage it can't, what aggravation of Folly and Shame is that in you? would you be feared and not loved, and ſtrive for that ſweet Harmony of Love and Fear together? regard your Honour, but joyn with it Parental Affections; between ſuch Parents and Children that live as they ought, what a ſweet Harmony is there, <hi>James</hi> 1.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13, 23.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5th. Reaſon</hi> is, Becauſe when Children are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, they are in the fitteſt poſture for Satan to work upon them by his Temptations: Satan delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fiſh in troubled Waters, the terrible ſmoak of Fury that doth aſcend, occaſioned by Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ſo far darkeneth the Eyes of the Mind, that now any Temptation ſuits, and the Party being blinded cannot diſcover it, (without the ſpecial grace of God.) The Aſtronomers tell us, that the Inferior Orbs are reſtrained in their motion by the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or elſe they would ſet all the World on fire. So if the Grace of God and true Religion do not keep Perſons in due Order, Satan hath too much combuſtible matter to work upon in the Soul, to ſet the whole courſe of Nature on fire, by his manifold Evil and Subtil Temptations, therefore Parents, take heed of giving Satan an Inch, leaſt he when he hath gotten a little footing on them, inſtead of an Inch he take an Ell, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. <hi>James</hi> 4.7.</p>

               <p>I come in <hi>the next place to give you ſome general rules for your better direction in almoſt all your carriages, towards your Children, from their Birth to Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and further. And here I muſt begin with you Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers firſt, for ſo is our Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Direction.</hi> Do not let your Children be too long abſent from you, when they are young and tender, neither in perſon as well as in heart; by long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence real natural love is worn out: I do here appeal to the experience of many Men and Women too, who have, when they have had a loving Husband or Wife, reſolved never to forget their Embraces, nor to be joyned to another in marriage, yet when Death hath parted them, length of time hath worn out the ſharp edge of their affections, their real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love which was ſo in very deed, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dull, lame, and very weak, that another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhall take place, which before length of time had worn out the ſharpneſs of it, it would have been utterly deſpiſed and condemned, (though now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced) makes the Proverb true, <hi>Long abſent, ſoon forgotten.</hi> You Fathers which never had the Care and Tuition of your Children, when young, are not apt to put that value upon them which your conſtant preſence, and their tattleing pleaſant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, would always induce you to; we are apt to value thoſe things moſt, that coſts us moſt; ſo our Children that are with us always, we our ſelves have always the trouble with, and care for, we do really love, when the very ſame Children if brought up without our care, in our abſence, love, except true grace prevent and prompt us to it, will be but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33360:19"/>yea, very much wanting, if any at all; ſo that I do adviſe you Parents, if you would bare and continue real natural and true love to your Children, take the pains to have the Tuition of, and Care for your Children while young, that your heart, love, with your pains and care, may be towards them always, at all Times and Places, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Direction</hi> is to you Mothers, (for our Text reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you as well as Fathers) That if it be poſſible, give your Children ſuck your ſelves. The Mothers milk is fitteſt to nouriſh the Child, as being congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to its nature and complection; it is a General Maxime, that Children take after them they ſuck; 'tis ſaid of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> that he ſucked a drunken Nurſe, and he was much given to that Vice. Dogs love moſt that game that you feed them with the blood of when young: Let a Lamb ſuck a Goat, and its nature and property ſhall be altered; ſo let a Whelp ſuck a Cat, and his game will be Rats and Mice: So likewiſe Children will ſhare with their Nurſe (except true grace prevent) of all their Vices. Mothers beſt know their own Inclinations, but they may be greatly miſtaken in a Nurſe, whoſe natural Inclinations may be very great to many groſs evils, but either they carrry it very ſecretly and cloſe, or elſe they want fit Opportunity to act in their Vices. You do not know the nature of a Serpent, but by ſtirring and provoking of him: So Some Women are never known what they are, till they be proved. If illneſs of body will not permit you to nurſe them your ſelves, or if you know you are naturally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſome groſs evil, that you would not have your Child follow you in, 'tis far better to take one years trouble, to bring it up by hand, than to venter it under the ſlender care of one who can have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love to it, (whoſe care may be like <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheths</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:33360:20"/>Nurſe, to make him a cripple all days of his life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.4.) more eſpecially, ſince you know not what vices they may ſuck in with the Milk; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Women have not that real, natural, love, for thoſe Children that they do not nurſe themſelves, as they have to them they do. So likewiſe, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being long abſent from them while young, their love is weaned from them ſo much, that they have ſcarce any love to them at all. Parents gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love thoſe Children moſt, that reſemble them in Perſons, Qualities, and Actions; then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if you would have your Children reſemble you, nurſe them your ſelves: <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Samuel, Solomon, Moſes,</hi> and many others were nurſed by their own Mothers, as the Scripture witneſſeth: Many are the advantages and benefits that ariſe both to Child and Mother too, by nurſing of them themſelves: As,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Mother letting it lye and ſuck near her heart, her heart love is towards the Child continually.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Mothers care in preſerving it, is far way beyond a Nurſe in preſerving it, from too much cold or heat, from hunger and crying, from fretting and chaffing of the Skin, from Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and many other evils, as Worms, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Coſtiveneſs and Fluxes, Coughs, Hiccoughs, Inflamations, Contuſions, trouble of Wind, and Ruptures, all which are incident to Children; as alſo to preſerve them from fire, water, and bruiſes, and the like.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As their Love is naturally towards them, ſo their care is continually of and for them in all things. <hi>Sarah</hi> rejoyced that ſhe ſhould give her Child ſuck, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.7. She was not ſo unnatural as to ſend it out of Doors ſo ſoon as it was born, not regarding it, as though it were none of her
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33360:20"/>own, as ſome Women do, (who are worſe to their young than the ſavage beaſts of the field) that will not take care to nurſe, preſerve, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their young ones; it is looked on as a judgment by the Prophet, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.14. What, (ſaith he) wilt thou them give a miſcarrying womb and dry breaſts? moſt Women are much troubled, if they cannot bare Children, then why not much more, if they do not let them ſuck of that Milk which nature has provided for the Childs nouriſhment? it is a ſmall ſign of remorſe, when they are not troubled for that which is their own proper faults.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fouthly,</hi> All Children do naturally love thoſe Parents moſt whom they ſucked, to take care for, aſſiſt and help in their neceſſities when old; if there be a kind of an Affection in Nurſes to thoſe they nurſe, and a peculiar love in the Child to the Nurſe whom it ſucked till death, much more the Natural Affections of a Child to its Natural Parents who bore it, and nouriſhed it with their own milk; what other Benefits ariſe thereby, I leave it to your Experience to witneſs in length of time. Nurſe your Children your ſelves, do not, as tis ſaid of the Deer, that they repulſe and ſeparate thoſe that are impotent; do not turn your Children out of doors, leaſt they in time have the ſame Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and you your ſelves ſhare of the like fare from them; 'tis the ſin of the laſt times, to be without natural Affections, therefore take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſe that the effect may ceaſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Direction</hi> is, Dedicate your Children to the moſt High, offer them up in your Prayers, Wiſhes and Deſires to the Lords omnipotent Care and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Hannah</hi> dedicated <hi>Samuel</hi> unto the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>Direction.</hi> Parents, be ſure you agree together in your Commads: Let not the Father command one thing, and the Mother preſently contradict it before the Child, this will harden them in Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; the firſt Precept to the Woman after the tranſgreſſion, was, to be ſubject to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he ſhould rule over her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. But that Woman is very impudent, that is ſo far from obeying her Husband, that ſhe will Lord it over him, by contradicting his Authority in juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and more eſpecially when ſo much evil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, as in this caſe, Parents ſhould both take great care, not to oppoſe each other before their Children, but chiefly when it is about their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens duty, but to take another fit Opportunity in cool Blood, in Love, and in their Childrens ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to diſpute the lawfulneſs of the matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Direction.</hi> Keep your Children in due ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, before they be too ſtubborn; <hi>He that ſpareth the rod hateth his Son, but he that loveth him chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him betimes,</hi> Prov. 13.24. <hi>Chaſten thy ſon while there is hope, and let not thy ſoul ſpare for his crying,</hi> Prov. 19.18. <hi>Rods and Reproof give Wiſdom, but a Child left to himſelf, brings his Mother to ſhame,</hi> Prov. 29.15. <hi>Correct thy ſon, and he ſhall give thee reſt, and delight unto thy ſoul,</hi> Prov. 29.17.

               <p n="6">6 <hi>Direction,</hi> Let your Children be your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy in this World: Rejoyce in them, as they are the gift of the Lord, but do not idolize them; good <hi>Job</hi> took delight enough in his Children, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſeth, <hi>Job</hi> 19.17. Chap. 29.5.

And as we muſt eat bread if we would live, ſo we muſt by Faith feed on Chriſt, receive Chriſt for Life, Righteouſneſs, and Eternal Life, if we would ſpiritually live and be ſaved.

Alſo how they come to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lords Supper from Night to Noon, from breaking the Bread to cutting of it, and from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at a Table to kneeling; I ſay, how this comes to be altered, and kneeling one by one, (at Noon) at the Altar, and there to receive a peice of Bread cut ſquare, I leave the <hi>Criticks</hi> of our age to determine; for certain, Chriſt gave no Man power to alter his Sacraments, neither in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not form, but they are to continue as they were firſt inſtituted to the end of the World, or till Chriſts ſecond coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. It muſt needs be a nullity of the Sacraments, if the right matter and manner be wanting; may I be ſo bold to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.20. Plain it is, that <hi>Paedorantiſm</hi> is not Chriſt's Ordinance of Baptiſm. O 'tis very dangerous to alter any thing in the worſhip of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. Ch. 12.32. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did but take common fire, and did not take it from the Altar, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.8. and the Lord ſlew them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2. Here they had the right mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (fire) but only they miſſed the right place where they ſhould have taken it: Alſo <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who were not of that tribe which the Lord appointed to offer incenſe, but rebelled againſt the Lord, and they were ſwallowed up alive in the Earth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.1, 3. Here was the wrong ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33360:28"/>Moreover, the Lord commanded that the Altar ſhould be made of unhewed ſtone, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Dent.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Joſhua</hi> 8.31.) But <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinned in making Altars of Brick, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.3. And the Lord was provoked thereby; their ſin was in the falſe ſubject; alſo the Lord commanded that the Offering ſhould be offered at the door of the Tabernacle, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.9. but they offered in Groves, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.4, 6, 15. Here they miſſed the place, and are charged with great guilt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.4. what ſhall I ſay more, they that add to any of Chriſts commands, or diminiſh from them in any kind, the Lord will viſit them in his anger, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.18. therefore teach your children to walk in the footſteps of the Church, in its primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as near as you can comprehend and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and as you find it recorded in the New-Teſtament.

               <p n="21">21 <hi>Direction</hi> is, Often awakening your Childrens conſciences, by ſtirring them up to avoid all ſin, and to live to God in all holy duties: Conſcience is like a cloſet, being locked up none ſees what is in it, but the Owners conſcience may (like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Ship) lye faſt aſleep in the midſt of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dangers, till it be rouzed up, but being awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'twill ſhew the danger of their condition: <hi>It is the Candle of the Lord,</hi> in man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Job</hi> 21.17.

If ſome of your Children be half-witted, crooked, or deformed, or of a perverſe nature, this is no ſufficient argument to withdraw your love from them; the Lord might ſuffer theſe things, on purpoſe to prove your natural Affections, that ye ſin not, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.20. Good <hi>David divided the ſpoil of the Amalikites equally to thoſe that did not, nor could not fight, as well as to thoſe that were able and ſtood battle.</hi> 1 Sam. 30.24. Take him in this, for your pattern, and let your love be to all alike, mind this, that une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual carriage is one ſtep to the Childs provocation, as I ſhewed you before.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33360:32"/>it has committed, you ſhould make your child as ſenſible of its fault by words to the purpoſe, as of the ſmart by the rod of correction, and then you may bow their ſtubborn heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. Alſo if they be dull and ſlow of capacity, you muſt not be too fierce, haſty and violent upon them, it will hurry them beyond, or out of themſelves, that they will be capable of juſt nothing at all; if they be wild, you muſt be fierce, but if they be mild, you muſt uſe all the lenity and mildneſs that is poſſible, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs.</hi>

                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> By Sleeping, or lying on Bed too long on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Day Morning; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Sluggard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, and has nothing, Prov.</hi> 13.4.

               <p>This was one of the Sins, for which <hi>Iſrael</hi> went into Captivity, <hi>Amos,</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by Idleneſs, they will ſit ſtill, and neither go to hear a Sermon, nor yet will they read in the Bible or other Book of Divinity, by which they might receive ſome good Inſtructions, nor will they Pray, nor uſe Divine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33360:39"/>Meditations, or other Holy Duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2, 3. but their <hi>Idle Soul ſhall ſuffer Hunger,</hi> Prov. 19.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, conſider your ways,</hi> Hag. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="3">

Many will imploy themſelves ſecretly on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and do that which they are not willing their Neighbour ſhould know of; but ſome will Sin more openly, but they do that which the Law will not take hold of them for their ſo doing, or chooſe Morning and Evening for the doing it, that it may be the eaſier paſſed by.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by gaming, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and playing that Day; <hi>Againſt whom do you Sport your ſelves? againſt whom do you make a wide Mouth, and draw out the Tongue? are ye not Children of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and ſeed of Falſhood?</hi> Iſaiah 67.4. Such are Spots and Blemiſhes in the Church, who Sport themſelves with their own deceiving, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Iſrael</hi> is complained of, that <hi>they Sate down to Eat, and to Drink, and roſe up to Play,</hi> Exod. 32.6. 1 Cor. 10.7.</p>
               <p n="5">

               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by uſing much vain diſcourſe: That day, they will gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Companies to tell and hear any kind of vain Stories and Tales, by which comes abundance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yea, and ill-will among Neighbours, Friends and Relations, therefore well might the Lord give it in charge to <hi>Iſrael, Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer,</hi> Levit. 19.16. <hi>The words of a Tale-bearer are as wounds,</hi> Prov. 18.8, 26, 22. <hi>Therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips,</hi> Prov. 20.19. <hi>where there is no Tale-bearer the ſtrife ceaſeth,</hi> Prov. 26.20. <hi>In the multitude of words there wants no ſin,</hi> Prov. 10.19. <hi>Death and Life are in the power of the Tongue,</hi> Prov. 18.21. <hi>For every idle word that a man ſhall ſpeak, he ſhall give an account in the day of judgment,</hi> Mat. 12.36. <hi>Therefore let thy Words be few,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2.

               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7thly.</hi> Some Men break the Sabbath by letting their eyes wander after divers Objects, and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carry away the heart from the benefit of the Word preached, that they can have no profit by it; ſuch had need with good <hi>Job</hi> reſolve <hi>to make a Covenant with their eyes,</hi> Job 31.1. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They have hid their eyes from my Sabbath,</hi> Ezek. 22.26. But good <hi>David</hi> was very careful in this matter, when he prayeth, <hi>O let me not wander from thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.10.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>8thly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by letting their hearts run after the concerns of this life, while they are under the hearing of the Word; of this ſort of People were they which the Lord complains of, <hi>They ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them, for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:33360:40"/>Ezek. 33.31. They cry. <hi>when will the Sabbath be over, that we may ſell corn,</hi> Amos 8.5.

               <p n="9">
                  <hi>9ly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by counting the time of hearing a Burthen: Such were they the Lord exclaims againſt, ſaying, <hi>When will the New Moon be gone, that we may ſell corn, and when will the Sabbath be over, that we may ſet forth wheat, making the Ephah ſmall, and the Shekel great?</hi> Amos 8.5. <hi>The Word of the Lord is to them a reproach, they have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it,</hi> Jer. 6.10. Theſe do not take delight in approaching to God, nor do they call the Sabbath a delight, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, 13.

               <p n="10">
                  <hi>10ly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath by their ſpend it in reading vain Books, that do rather inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their vile nature to ſin, than to ſhew them the way of Mortification, Regeneration, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which is contained in the Holy Scriptures, which ought to be the only Book which a Chriſtian ſhould read and ſtudy: St. <hi>Paul reaſoned out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> Acts 17.2. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for <hi>ſearching the Scriptures daily, Acts</hi> 17.11. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the moſt profitable Book in the World, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, <hi>to</hi> 17. And therefore Chriſt bids the <hi>Jews ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> John 5.39. Yea, the Apoſtles themſelves were raviſhed with Chriſt's expounding of the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. It were much better that they that have any vain books,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33360:40"/>would do as the people of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did, <hi>to burn them,</hi> rather than to ſpend time on the Sabbath day to read them, or any other time elſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <hi>11ly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath in Drunkenneſs and Gluttony; many will flock together in private Ale-houſes, and other private Houſes, and ſend for ſuch things as their Hearts luſts after, and fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till they are overcharged with ſufeiting and drunkenneſs, which ought not to be, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. And when Sermon is over, they let their Reins run at random, and take their fill without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of any, till they are under that woe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Theſe that count it pleaſure to riot in the day time, and have their eyes full of Adultery, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe from ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.13, 14. which St. <hi>Paul</hi> poſitively forbids, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.</p>

                  <hi>12ly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath in ſleeping in the time of Hearing of the Word preached: Theſe are totally without the ſence of their eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery, they are as it were men without Souls, for they have no real Sence nor Knowledge of their future being, they quite forget that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word is their Souls harveſt: <hi>Learn of the Ant O thou ſluggard, which gathereth her meat in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi> Prov. 6.6, to 12. If thou doſt not, thy want ſhall come on thee as an armed Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.34. <hi>He that ſleepeth in harveſt, is a Son that cauſeth ſhame,</hi> Prov. 10.5. Sleepineſs diſcovers a ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.15. And too great want, when it is too late, will be the Iſſue, as in the caſe of the five fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.5, 8. Such Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ought to pray with good <hi>David</hi> unto the Lord, <hi>To enlighten their eyes leaſt they ſleep the ſleep of death,</hi> Pſal. 13.3. Were theſe very people but hearing of a Tale told, or any vain Diſcourſe, it is a great chance but they would be awake enough to laugh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33360:41"/>at it, and perhaps to help it forward too; all implying that they have no feeling in their hearts of a future being, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18, 19.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <hi>13ly.</hi> Some break the Sabbath in letting or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their Children, Servants, or Cattel, to do any unneceſſary buſineſs that day: The Lord gave it in charge that the Children of Iſrael ſhould do no ſervile work in the day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.7, 8. of the wave offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.21. in the convocation of blowing Trumpets, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.25. <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.1. on the day of the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.18. in the days of faſting, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.28. <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.7. on the week of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.12, 35.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33360:51"/>Chriſt or his Apoſtles did ever leave any Precept or Preſident for the ſo doing, and therefore it is an Innovation of Men, and largely forbidden in the Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is not the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in thoſe that were Excommunicated for Trifles?

Let me add here a word or two concerning Juſtification. The real cauſes of Juſtification are theſe: <hi>1ſt.</hi> The <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> is God's free grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe</hi> is the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>3ly.</hi> The <hi>material cauſe</hi> is Chriſt's active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>4ly.</hi> The <hi>formal cauſe</hi> is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>5ly. The inſtrumental cauſe</hi> by which it is applied, is Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>6ly.</hi> The <hi>final cauſe</hi> is, <hi>1ſt.</hi> The glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. And, <hi>2ly.</hi> Mans Salvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. but where good works have any place as a cauſe of juſtification, I find not, for they do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow from Faith, and are the fruits and effects of true Faith. <hi>1st. What is not of Faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>2ly. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>3ly.</hi> Man is united to Chriſt by Faith, and by it its fruits appears, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4, 6. <hi>4ly.</hi> As Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>gather grapes of thorns, or figgs of thiſtles,</hi> Mat. 7.16.

               <p n="39">39 <hi>Direction</hi> is, When your Children are come to years, you ought to take care of their being diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Marriage, and that in that ſeaſonable and due time, as you find their natural inclinations prompt them to and require it.</p>

                  <p>So alſo thou muſt with patience ſubmit thy ſelf under the diſcipline of a true Church of Chriſt: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſubmit to the Authority of Magiſtratical Power and Rulers, under all moral and civil Laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for they in a Nation are as Parents, ruling under Divine Authority. Atheiſm and Idolatry are as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to divine power, as Adultery, Theft or Murder,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33360:69"/>and other criminal Facts, and ought to be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the civil laws, but in point of matter, time and manner, relating to the worſhip of the Trinity in Unity, none have power, neither Prelate nor Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to make or impoſe laws to compel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it being Vicegerent, only under divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that none can compel or command it; the carnal Sword may put the Mind into fear, and alſo wound the Body, but it cannot hurt the Conſcience; the moſt it can do, is to fright ſome into Hypocriſie, but for certain it never makes good Chriſtians. We read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no dominion over the Churches faith, neither can Pope, Conclave, Councils, Convocations, nor Magiſtratical Powers, by Fines, Impriſonment, Inquiſition, Exilement or Confiſcation of Goods, nor Death; but the Tares and Wheat ought to grow together till the Harveſt, (which is the end of the World) <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30, 39. Our Saviour taught a good Leſſon, if thoſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could but learn it, <hi>To do to all men, even as we would have they ſhould do to us,</hi> Mat. 7.12. Luke 6.30. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers,</hi> Rom. 13.1.

But his meaning muſt be in civil things. Again, where St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. He ſhews you their Authority is only to afflict evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not the conſcientious perſons, for if ſo, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been guilty, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.18, 19.
